Face and Eye Detection Using OpenCV

This project demonstrates real-time face and eye detection using OpenCV and Haar Cascade classifiers. The script captures video from the webcam, processes each frame to detect faces and eyes, and highlights them with rectangles.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
OpenCV
Install OpenCV: pip install opencv-python
Usage
Place haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml and haarcascade_eye.xml in the project directory.

Run the script: python face_eye_detection.py
This will open a window showing the webcam feed with detected faces and eyes highlighted.
